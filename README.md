# PISCESv1_1D

As part of my PhD I created a 1D biogeochemical configuration based on PISCES model (version 1 - Bopp et al, 2005) 
The configuration was created to study the impact of environmental changes (mainly Mixed Layer Depth and Light) over Southern Ocean primary production, from the seasonal to decadal scales. The results of these studies can be found in Llort, 2015 and Llort et al, 2015. Nicholson et al, 2016 used the same configuration but with some additional modifications (not in this repository).

Edits in these routines are mainly additional outputs for equation terms affecting phytoplankton growth and limiting factors. The vertical grid was also modified to reduce the impact of a very idealised MLD seasonal cycle of the plankton response.
